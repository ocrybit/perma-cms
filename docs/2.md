# Hash Routing with PermaApp

Apps deployed on Arweave are basically single-page static websites. And there is no server to process backend logic for multi-page routing.

There is only one root entry URL on your app. And if you try to access the app at a sub-directory URL, you won't be able to load it.

- https://your.app works, and you can move around sub-directory URLs within the SPA
- https://your.app/page, however, doesn't work if you reload the app

In such cases, [hash routing](https://ardrive.arweave.dev/Content/routing.html) is your best friend.

- https://your.app/#/page works even if you reload the app!

## Hash Routing with Vite + React

You can modify the vite-react app from [the previous tutorial](./#/a/1).

### Install react-router-dom

Go to the root directory of your app.

```bash
yarn add react-router-dom
```

### Set up Routing in `/src/main.jsx`

```javascript
import React from "react"
import { RouterProvider, createHashRouter } from "react-router-dom"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client"
import Article from "./pages/Article"
import Admin from "./pages/Admin"

const router = createHashRouter([
  { path: "/", element: <App />  },
  { path: "/article/:id", element: <Article /> },
  { path: "/admin", element: <Admin /> }
])

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

### Link to Pages in `/src/App.jsx`

```javascript
import { Link } from "react-router-dom"

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
	  <Link to={`./admin`}><div>admin</div></Link>
      <Link to={`./artocle/1`}><div>article 1</div></Link>
	  <Link to={`./artocle/2`}><div>article 2</div></Link>
	  <Link to={`./artocle/3`}><div>article 3</div></Link>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

### Get Dynamic Parameters in `/src/pages/Article.jsx`

When using a dynamic parameter like `/article/:id`, you can access URLs such as

- `https://your.app/#/article/1`
- `https://your.app/#/article/my-article-about-ao`

and get the `:id` part with `useParams()`.

```javascript
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom"

function Article(a) {
  const { id } = useParams()
  return <div>article {id}</div>
}

export default Article
```

### Deploy PermaDapp

Now when you deploy the app on Arweave following [the previous tutorial](./#/a/1), the multi-page hash routing will magically work!

```bash
arkb deploy dist -w path_to_keyfile --auto-confirm
```
