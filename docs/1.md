# Deploy PermaApp on Arweave

The easiest way to deploy a single-page-app on Arweave.

## Create Vite App

Make sure you have [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) installed globally.

```bash
sudo npm install -g vite
```

This example will work with Vite + React with Javascript + SWC.

```bash
npm create vite@latest myapp -- -t react-swc
cd myapp && yarn
```

Add `base: "./"` to `vite.config.js`. (**This is the most important step!**)  
This will correctly link all the file paths when the app is uploaded to Arweave.

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc"

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  base: "./",
  plugins: [react()],
})
```
You can modify the app and locally run it with `yarn dev` (or you can skip it).

Now build the app.

```bash
yarn build
```
## Deploy App on Arweave

We will use [arkb](https://github.com/textury/arkb).  
Make sure you have an Arweave account JSON keyfile with some `$AR` loaded.

```bash
sudo npm install -g arkb
```

Finally, deploy the app on Arweave.

```bash
arkb deploy dist -w path_to_keyfile --auto-confirm
```
After a few seconds, you will get an app url.

It was too easy!

## [Bonus] Set Arweave Domain Name

If you have your own Arweave Name from [ArNS](https://arns.app/), you can [set the Target ID](https://docs.ar.io/guides/arns/managing.html) to the transaction ID received when deploying the app (e.g. `_oliAd7vpL2gIXCpTnXHedhPhqpYJZrr0iMeItf6PDA`).

After some propagation period, your app will be accessible from any Arweave gateways.
